# Anver
Small android application for displaying substitution stuff of Gymnasium Andreanum more conveniently. Written in C# using Xamarin.

Please don't judge my code, I know it's ugly. This app was only intended as a proof of concept for me, wanting to work on a more polished version later down the line. Yeah, never got around to that, unfortunately. So you are stuck with this, which may be better than nothing, I guess.
